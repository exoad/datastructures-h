/*
Write a program that
demonstrates that the size of an
unsigned integer and a normal
integer are the same, and that
both are smaller in size than a
long integer (and long long if
youâ€™d like).

Write a program to calculate the
area and circumference of a
circle, where the user supplies
the radius.
